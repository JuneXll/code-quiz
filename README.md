#This quiz will run through a series of questions. Along the way, the quiz will let you know if your answer was correct or wrong. 
#If a wrong answer has been clicked, ten seconds will be deducted from you running timer.
#Once the quiz has been completed,you will be able to see the score and you will be able to enter your initials. 
#Once submitted, you can see your score on the highscores page. 
#You will be able to go back to the start and clear all the highscores on the the highscores page.

Some bugs that I couldn't figure out:
1.fix bug for the start button after quiz has been completed at least once, quiz will hold the current questions for 2 sec then jump to the finished page 
2.remove the dynamically appended p after every question to only show the current wrong/correct answer
3.set if statement if no initials are entered
4.lock score so it only counts the button clicked only once before the next question.
